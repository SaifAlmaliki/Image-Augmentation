# Image Augmentation in deep learning
(ImageDataGenerator) is Keras deep learning library provides the ability to use data augmentation automatically when training a model.

A range of techniques are supported, as well as pixel scaling methods. We will focus on five main types of data augmentation techniques for image data; specifically:

- Image shifts via the width_shift_range and height_shift_range arguments.

- Image flips via the horizontal_flip and vertical_flip arguments.

- Image rotations via the rotation_range argument.

- Image brightness via the brightness_range argument.

- Image zoom via the zoom_range argument.
